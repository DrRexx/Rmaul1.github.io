Is Juliana Gay? That was the question we were wondering that day, that dreadful day. One fateful day in September 2021 when 
Bryce was just a small fetus living inside of McChicken when he grew his limbs He was so relieved he could 
finally walk, and not be a fetus. As soon as he grew up to be a big boy he ate the chicken sandwich he had lived in for all 
those years. But that was when He found his purpose. A gorgeous, glistening, juicy, thicc, hunk of a man, his name was… Mason.
 “Ahh Mason,” He said, thinking how well the name rolled off the tongue as if it was meant to be. At that moment It was like a
 dream come true. Mason walked slowly towards Bryce as fast as he could, his heart violently palpitating with every step. Then,
 Mason asks the question Bryce has been waiting for since his conception, 4 minutes ago. Mason leans in real close and loudly 
exclaims “YOU GAY?”. “Yes,” Bryce squeals, struggling to hold in his excitement. Before Bryce even knew what was happening Mason
had asked,” hey wanna come with me to my Grandpas Sex Basement” \

        As Bryce followed Mason down the spooky staircase into the seemingly endless darkness he couldn't help but glance down at
Mason's violently sweaty ass. Once they finally arrived at the bottom of the stairs, Bryce started to undress. As the mason eyed 
him up and down he started to do the same.The Homeless lady, Juliana, who lived in the walls watched as Mason started to caress 
Bryce’s right breast, “One day you will Breastfeed our children with that nipple.” He thought to himself. Bryce slips his magnum 
dong inside of masons; making sure to put his monster condom on first. After a while of giving each other anal Bryce’s warm and 
sticky sperm slowly leaks into Mason’s ass. Suddenly Mason starts sucking Bryce's breast With immense amounts of passion, and most
 importantly, Love. ah yes, that's what this feeling is beyond all of the sweat, and sperm was love, yes love.

        “Woah… That was intense,” Bryce softly spoke to mason as climbing the stairs out of the Sex Dungeon. After a long pause Mason
 says to Bryce the most serious he has ever said anything, “Bryce… I- I think I love you” Bryce stands there in awe and slowly says, 
“I Love you too, mason.” once they arrive at the top of the stairs, after knowing each other for just a day we both almost in sync Said,
 “Wanna marry me”
